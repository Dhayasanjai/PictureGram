 ## Uploading pictures to firebase using React
 
 In this i made a React project with firebase  .In this you may any photos of jpeg or png format so then it will first stored in the firebase srorage after with that response i get the image url and then i  simply stored in firebase cloud firestore with some extra datas like file name and timestamp (firebase timestamp) . After that a snapShop function which triggers whenever the firestore has changes so that i will get the latest data and unsurprisingly i display in the screen with some cool transition with 'framer-motion' .and if you touches the photo it will comes up with a modal in that i have given the delete option for that photo if you delete it will automatically changes in the screen . And also i deployed in Google firebase itself so definately check it out  in have linked down below
